# dark-clock

## Description
I just got tired of time websites filled with ads and unnecessary clutter.

dark-clock is a clean, distraction-free web clock that combines a digital clock, stopwatch, and countdown timer in a modern dark interface.

It also comes with multiple dark-style themes, a hideable sidebar for focus, and an adjustable display size.

## Usage
Just open the link:

Or clone the repository and open `index.html` locally in your browser — it works fully offline.
